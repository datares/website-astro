# Data Science Career Fair

The Fall 2023 UCLA Careers in Data Science, Statistics, and Math Night is a career fair hosted by DataRes, NSDC, and UMSA, and the UCLA Career Center. This event is open to all UCLA students and is a great opportunity to network with companies and learn about the data science industry.

# ASA DataFest

[ASA DataFest@UCLA](http://datafest.stat.ucla.edu/) is an annual datathon hosted at UCLA and allows students to try and find the best insight, and communicate that insight, from a large, complex dataset in a time sensitive manner.

This year, we had 25+ DataRes members participate, including a team that won best use of statistical models!

# Social and Educational Events

At DataRes, we place a large emphasis on building a community within our club and we host a wide range of social and educational events for the public members!

A few examples include a laser tag social hosted on campus and a public info session about our DataLearn track happening during Fall 2022.

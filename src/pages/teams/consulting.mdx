# Our Services

We partner with startups, nonprofits, labs, and companies to transform raw data into clear, actionable insights. Our interdisciplinary teams combine technical depth and business intuition to drive real-world impact.

## üìä Data Analysis
We dive into raw datasets to uncover trends, patterns, and actionable insights.
Example: For Achievable, we analyzed student usage data to identify which actions were most strongly correlated with learning outcomes.

## üß† Predictive Modeling & Machine Learning
We design and train machine learning models for forecasting, segmentation, and classification.
Example: For **[Jazz Hands for Autism](https://www.jazzhandsforautism.org/)**, we built an optimization model to match students to ideal class schedules based on performance data, preferences, and instructor availability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Data Engineering & Infrastructure
We build scalable backend systems to collect, store, and query data effectively.
Example: For **Orsulic Lab**, we created a database-backed platform that connects front-end and back-end workflows, streamlining operations for medical research.

## üåê Web & Product Analytics
We analyze user journeys, optimize conversion funnels, and run A/B tests to boost engagement.
Example: With **[Kickback](https://drinkkickback.com/)**, we examined Shopify user data to pinpoint where shoppers were dropping off and set up experiments to test improvements.

## üìà Business Strategy & Insights
We combine data with competitive and market research to guide product, growth, and operations.
Example: For **[UCLA Housing/BruinShack](https://www.unishack.org/ucla)**, we scraped housing listings and analyzed survey data to inform strategies for improving off-campus student housing discovery.

## üó£Ô∏è Natural Language Processing (NLP)
We use NLP to extract insights from text, power AI tools, and automate workflows.
Example: With **[Zeitios](https://www.zeitios.com/)**, we‚Äôre building an AI tutor that helps students learn software tools, combining curriculum generation with NLP-powered dialogue.

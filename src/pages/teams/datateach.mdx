# What is DataTeach?

DataTeach is a committee that works on educational outreach by teaching local
high school students the basics of Data Science and mentoring students on
relevant projects similar to those produced by DataBlog. We are currently
recruiting individuals who are passionate about teaching and mentoring to join
us in our biweekly visit to University High School and set up their
Data Science club.

# What will I learn from joining DataTeach?

Through DataTeach, members get to learn about how to teach and mentor high
school students more effectively and how to create an inclusive and welcoming
learning environment for all. They will also learn how to design data science
curricula through power points or interactive materials, and collaborate with
like-minded individuals on expanding the curriculum.

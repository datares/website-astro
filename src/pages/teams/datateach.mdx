# What is DataTeach?

DataTeach is a committee that works on educational outreach by introducing high school students to the fundamentals and mentoring them through hands-on learning. We meet weekly with students over Zoom, guiding them through a two-part program: a structured curriculum covering core data science concepts, followed by a project phase where students apply their skills and showcase what theyâ€™ve learned. Each fall, we recruit new members who are passionate about teaching and mentoring to help support and inspire students at high schools across the region.

# What will I learn from joining DataTeach?

Through DataTeach, members get to learn about how to teach and mentor high school students more effectively and how to create an inclusive and welcoming learning environment for all. They will also learn how to design data science curricula through slide decks, interactive materials, or online videos, and collaborate with like-minded individuals on expanding the curriculum
